<strong>Background</strong><br><br>Lately, many people believe, that of the two NBA conferences, East and West, the Western conference has had much more talent. The background image, for example, shows 11 high caliber players from around the NBA in the 2016-2017 season and only 4 of those players were in the East (now only 2).
<br><br>One result is that, for the last three years, only the Cleveland Cavaliers have gotten to the NBA Finals from the Eastern Conference without much resistance. At the same time, there are teams in the Western conference that don't make the playoffs, even though they could probably go deep into the playoffs in the Eastern conference.
<br><br>Note: The Golden State Warriors are another story, in my opinion.

<strong>ConvertNBA Motivation</strong><br><br>ConvertNBA is meant to get a discussion going on the conference talent distribution. The All-Star game, for example, felt the effects of the disparity. In a welcomed change, the All-Start game is no longer a game of Eastern All-Stars vs. Western All-Stars, but both teams can pull talent from any conference.<br><br>With the changes to the All-Star game, the NBA conferences talent is even more noticeable in comparison. However, The All-Star game is only in one weekend, while the NBA schedule, based on the current conferences, happens most of the year. It won't be as simple a fix, but any fix would benefit from discussion from many different sources.<br><br>That's where we come in.

<strong>Who am I</strong><br><br>'We' involves everyone who can provide their perspective and knowledge on the topic. ConvertNBA is the creation of just one of those individuals. The Pacific, North Atlantic, Central, and Southeast conferences of this site are just the idea of one computer scientist. The possible regular season and playoff schedules are simply the thoughts of a 24 year old alumni from the University of Michigan. I'm not an expert on the topic; just a concerned fan.
