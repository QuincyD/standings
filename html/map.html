<p id='caption'>
The conferences you see above, Pacific, Central, Southeast, and North Atlantic, are an example of possible NBA conference changes. The possibility does not include divisions. 
</p>

<br>

<p id='description'>
<strong>Site's Revised Conferences</strong>
<br><br>
Both of the original conferences are split into two conferences apiece. The Pacific conference is essentially a Western Conference with 7 less teams and the North Atlantic is the Eastern conference with 8 less teams.
<br><br>
The Central and Southeast conferences divide the remaining teams into two other conferences. Southeast takes the southern 4 from the West and 3 from the East, while Central takes the northern 3 from the West and 5 from the East.
</p>

<br>

<p id='schedule'>
<strong>Schedule</strong>
<br><br>
The standings for the conferences are based on the current schedule. However, here is an ok example of how regular season and playoff schedules might work with the above conferences.

<strong>Regular Season</strong>

<br><br>

<em>General</em>

<br>

Each team has 3 requirements and an additional guideline to reach 82 games.
<ul>
    <li>Play 4 games against each team in their conference.</li>

    <li>Play 3 games against each team in the opposite conference</li>

    <li>Play 2 games against each of the teams in the remaining two conferences</li>

    <li>Play the remaining amount of the 82 games against any teams</li>
</ul>

<br>

<em>Each conference</em>

<br>

First, opposite means the opposite side of the United States where Pacific is west, North Atlantic is east, Central is north, and Southeast is south. With that in mind, each team in each conference is as follows:

<br><br>

<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Same Conference</th>
<th>Opp. Conference</th>
<th>Other Conferences</th>
<th>Remaining</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Central</em><br>(8 teams)</td>
<td>28 games</td>
<td>21 games</td>
<td>30 games</td>
<td>3 games</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>North Atlantic</em><br>(7 teams)</td>
<td>24 games</td>
<td>24 games</td>
<td>30 games</td>
<td>4 games</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Pacific</em><br>(8 teams)</td>
<td>28 games</td>
<td>21 games</td>
<td>30 games</td>
<td>3 games</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>Southeast</em><br>(7 teams)</td>
<td>24 games</td>
<td>24 games</td>
<td>30 games</td>
<td>4 games</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>

<em>Notes</em>

<br>

<ul>
<li>
You can't split 30 teams into four conferences evenly, so two conferences, Pacific and Central, have 8 and the other two, North Atlantic and Southeast, have 7.
</li>
<li>
No divisions were included in the new scheme, but they are included and taken into account for the current regular season guidelines. (current guidelines won't be listed here).
</li>
</ul>

<div id='playoffs_wrapper'>
<p id='playoffs'>
<strong>Playoffs</strong>

<br><br>

Top 4 teams from each conference go into conference bracket ranked by regular season records. Team ranked first plays last, etc. like usual. In the end, There will be 4 conference champions.

<br><br>

<em>It could progress two ways from here.</em>

<br><br>

The champions face off in a bracket until the NBA champions come out. Teams can only be 
conference champions and NBA champions. Example:
<br><br>
<img src='../imgs/playoff1.png'>

<br><br>

<em>or</em>

<br><br>

Semi Finals see the conference champions face off, contingent on not allowing the Pacific conference champions to face the North Atlantic conference champions. Then the game with Pacific conference champions would be the Western (super) conference finals and the game with the North Atlantic conference champions could be the Eastern (super) conference finals.

<br><br>

The Eastern and Western conference champions still face off as normal, but teams from the 
mid-conferences could be both Eastern or Western conference champions in different 
years. Example:

<br><br>
<img src='../imgs/playoff2.png'>

<br><br>

<em>Notes</em>
<ul>
    <li>Not allowing Pacific to play North Atlantic in semi-finals of the second scenario is primarily for travel considerations to limit the possible difference in travel times and time zone changes.</li>
    <li>Even though two conferences have only 7 teams, as opposed to 8, battling for 4 spots, the rationale is that teams as high as the 7th seed, or even 6th seed, won't usually provide a lot of added competition to the conferences.</li>
    <li>Even if the current conferences may be evenly skilled some years, the possibility is always there. Either of the above playoff schemes won't allow half of the NBA to have all the talent in one playoff conference.</li>
</ul>
