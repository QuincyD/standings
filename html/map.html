<strong>Site's Revised Conferences</strong>

Both of the original conferences are split into two conferences apiece. The Pacific conference is essentially a Western Conference with 7 less teams and the North Atlantic is the Eastern conference with 8 less teams.
<br><br>
The Central and Southeast conferences divide the remaining teams into two other conferences. Southeast takes the southern 4 from the West and 3 from the East, while Central takes the northern 3 from the West and 5 from the East.
