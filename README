# standings
A JavaScript driven web page to display possible NBA standings
based on converted conferences. Online at: www.convertNBA.tk

To use locally, simply pull and visit index.html

Run get_standings.py to update standings after official NBA games

Run new_confs.py to yield the conversions json file, new_confs.json

To adjust to other conference configuration, change new_confs.py,
the tables in index.html and adjust the conferences in converter.js
and displayStandings.js

TODO: Once new_confs.json is changed, automatically adjust page to
display the desired standings for the conversions.
