# standings
A JavaScript driven web page to display possible NBA standings
based on converted conferences. No longer live online.

To use locally, pull the code and visit index.html.

Run python/get_standings.py to update standings after official
NBA games

Run python/create_new_confs.py to yield the conversions json file,
new_confs.json

You may get the error below when you visit the html pages:
"XMLHttpRequest cannot load file://<json file url>
Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes:
http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https."

One work around is to go to the standings directory in a terminal
and run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" to create a simple server to
host the site and go to that address in your browser.

Conferences can be customized on the site, but to adjust the
default converted conferences, adjust the conferences in
python/create_new_confs.py and change conference_names in
showSiteCustom() function of js/which.js.
